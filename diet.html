  <h1>Diet Plan:</h1>
  <h3>Carbohydrates:</h3>
  <p>Firstly, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body and therefore play the most substantial role in fueling exercise.</p>
  <h3>Protein:</h3>
  <p> A gym diet plan must include protein. During exercise, the body is exposed to strains and stresses. This cause damage to occur to the muscles at a microscopic level. So, in order to repair the damage, protein is needed.</p>
  <h3>Fats:</h3>
  <p>Fats are often incorrectly seen as the primary reason for fat gain. However, fats are not responsible for this and actually play a key role in the absorption and transport of nutrients. In addition, they can have a positive impact on heart health and hormone production.</p>
  <h3>A proper diet plan:</h3>
